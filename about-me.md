Hello, my name is Jorden Lowe. If you want to get ahold of me, you can use Twitter at JordenLowe or just email me at: <jordenashleylowe@gmail.com>

I used to live and work in downtown Detroit, but now I work at Panasonic as a Project Lead for a Cloud platform. I produced applications (ranging from web services to win forms to HTML 5).  While most of my experience has been in the .net space, now I write Ruby at my current gig.

I love to tinker with software outside of work too.  My github page is here:  https://github.com/supermitsuba , which includes a node.js blog engine I wrote, to the code I wrote for my IoT LED bulletin board.

Why do I write this blog?

I find that code and engineering principles are lacking in most places. I want to encourage others to look at their code and improve it constantly. That means using unit testing, design patterns, data structures and algorthims, and following code standards through code analysis. Once you get into that mindset, then you can concentrate on the business&#8217;s problem effectively.
